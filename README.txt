1. The Website I chose out of the three allocated to me is https://www.adv3nture.xyz/ 

2. I tried to replicate as close as possible to the original design of the website within the given stipulated time.

3. As asked I chose a name and designed a logo for the website.

4. I went with the name Voyage and website name as voyage.r 
	because the adventourous game represents a journey or a 'Voyage' for a user i.e., a 'voyager'.

5. All hyperlinks available in the original website have been added and they take the user to designated destinations,
	has not yet been made responsive for different screen sizes due to time constraint.
	

Thank you PixelBridges for the opportunity! Would love to work with you guys.
